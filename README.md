# Audio Recorder

This is a code snippet/example for using RecorderJS with the web audio input feature to record audio from
[Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html).  
- MONO waw -
This is just an example by [axew3](https://www.axew3.com/w3/) of a modified version of the [AudioRecorder](https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder) waw encoder, that convert to MONO waw (not stereo, so it is suitable to be used for google speech API) and save on disk the waw file as basic example.
Improve initAudio function on main.js for a more recent javascript code.
