# Audio Recorder

This is a code snippet/example for using RecorderJS with the web audio input feature to record audio from
[Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html).  
- MONO waw -
This is a modified version of the https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder
waw encoder. 
Convert to mono waw (not stereo, so it is suitable to be used for google speech API) and save on disk the waw file as basic example.
Little improve initAudio function on main.js for a more recent javascript code.
