# Audio Recorder

This is a code snippet/example for using RecorderJS with the web audio input feature to record audio from
[Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html).  

This is a modified version of the https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder
waw encoder. This convert to mono waw, and save on disk the waw file as basic example.
Little improve initAudio function on main.js for a more recent javascript code.
